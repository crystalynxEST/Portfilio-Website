                <h2> Born and raised in Estonia, now residing in the UK, I am a multi-talented individual on a mission to become a full-fledged web and software developer. My passion for technology is matched only by my love for creative pursuits like graphic design and traditional drawing. When I'm not coding or sketching, you can find me immersed in a video game, playing with my feline friends, cozying up with my partner, getting lost in a good book, or exploring the great outdoors. Always up for a challenge, I relish in the opportunity to learn something new every day.
